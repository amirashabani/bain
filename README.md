# bain - the battery indicator

![Arch Example](example/Arch.png)
<sup>\*green: discharge, yellow: charge, red: battery percentage < 30%</sup>

## How to use?

* Install `imagemagick` and `feh`, because this program uses them

```bash
sudo pacman -S imagemagick feh
```

* Make sure you're in `$HOME` directory

```bash
cd
```

* Clone the repository, and `cd` into it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirashabani/bain
cd bain
```

* Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x bain.sh
```

* Run the script from your startup file (e.g. `.xinitrc`). Make sure to use `&` at the end of the command as it is a blocking script.
```bash
$HOME/bain/bain.sh arch &
```

* Restart your X session (log out and log back in).
```bash
pkill X
```
